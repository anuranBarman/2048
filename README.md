# 2048

Famous 2048 game made in Flutter. This code was originally written by [anuranBarman](https://github.com/anuranBarman/2048) three years ago.

Since there was no activity for this amazing repo, I, [Nagaraj Alagusundaram](https://www.nagaraj.com.au) wished to resolve all the issue that was raised. Along with that I have also

* Upgraded the code to [Flutter 2.0](https://dart.dev/dart-2)
* Migrated the code to [Sound Null Safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety/migration-guide)
* Added [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) test coverage
* Followed strict Lint rules. Thanks to [very_good_analysis](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_analysis/blob/main/README.md)
* Added [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions). Thanks to [subosito](https://github.com/subosito/flutter-action)
* Added [flutter_bloc](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/tree/master/packages/flutter_bloc) as state management. Thanks to [Felix](https://github.com/felangel)
* Used dart [collections](https://pub.dev/packages/collection) where ever possible
